## Description

[Rook](https://github.com/rook/rook) is an open source orchestrator providing file, block, and object storage services for distributed storage systems running in cloud-native environments.

This module installs and configures Rook on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Setup

To install the rook module, add the `rook` class to the manifest file:

```puppet
include 'rook'
```

When the `rook` class is declared, Puppet does the following:
* Downloads and installs the Ceph packages.
* Configures Rook on Kubernetes.

## Usage

To customize options, such as the release channel, add the following code to the manifest file:

```puppet
class { 'rook':
  version => 'v0.7.0',
}
```

### Tasks

Included in the rook module is an example task that creates the rook namespace, and executes the kubectl tasks to configure rook on kubernetes.

```puppet
bolt task run rook::rook_namespace kubeconfig=<path-to-config-file> namespace=<namespace-title> ---nodes <k8s-node-name> --user <user> --password <password> --modulepath <module-path>
```

```puppet
bolt task run rook::rook_create kubeconfig=<path-to-config-file> config_file=<path-to-config-file> ---nodes <k8s-node-name> --user <user> --password <password> --modulepath <module-path>
```

For additional information on how to execute a task, see the [PE](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2018.1/running_tasks.html) documentation or the [Bolt](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/writing_tasks_and_plans.html) documentation.

### Validating and unit testing the module

This module is compliant with the Puppet Development Kit [(PDK)](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/1.x/pdk_install.html), which provides tools to help run unit tests on the module and validate the modules' metadata, syntax, and style.

*Note:* To run static validations and unit tests against this module using the [`pdk validate`](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/1.x/pdk_testing.html#concept-3313) and [`pdk test unit`](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/1.x/pdk_testing.html#concept-3975) commands, you must be using Puppet 5 or higher. In the following examples, we have specified Puppet 5.5.3.

To validate the metadata.json file, run the following command:

```
pdk validate metadata --puppet-version='5.5.3'
```

To validate the Puppet code and syntax, run the following command:

```
pdk validate puppet --puppet-version='5.5.3'
```

To unit test the module, run the following command:

```
pdk test unit --puppet-version='5.5.3'
```
